* don't add alarms to the past. this can happen due to 60s margin before
  maneuver node.

! find why align_solar points to either north or south. that's weird

* iterative update for alarms

* removing alarms. some owner-specific #ids might be used

* after-stage probe aligning doesn't work well if some of them have
  apoapsis>80k while others don't

! try to keep 1.8 twr after 32000k; decrease pitch maneuver starting speed;
increase 32000k border to 35k
