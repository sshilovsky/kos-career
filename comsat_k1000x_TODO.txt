* don't add alarms to the past. this can happen due to 60s margin before
  maneuver node.

! find why align_solar points to either north or south. that's weird

* iterative update for alarms

* removing alarms. some owner-specific #ids might be used

! try to keep 1.8 twr after 32000k; decrease pitch maneuver starting speed;
increase 32000k border to 35k

* try WAIT to synchronize hasnode/nextnode/remove operations

* keep suborbital insertion related data in file on volume 0: list of ship names and/or their align status

* iterative sync; fix sync errors
